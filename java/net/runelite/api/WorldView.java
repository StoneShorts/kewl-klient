	 *  accepted, nothing computed, nothing drawn, no minimap marker. The earlier contract ("callers
	 *  must not treat -1 as a floor, so nothing draws at a wrong height") bought nothing here: with
	 *  no heightmap (Perspective.getTileHeight is 0) everything is drawn at datum height anyway.
	 *  Cost of the assumption: upstairs, with an unreadable plane, the path is computed from the
	 *  ground-floor tile under the player. {@code kewl.rl.AutoWalk} reads {@code Game.me().plane()}
	 *  directly and keeps its own -1 handling (walks without the plane filter). NOT VERIFIED which

	 * FALSE ALWAYS, and that is a LIE rather than a blank: nothing here can tell an instance from open

	 *
	 * <p>Not derivable, and here is the reason rather than a shrug. An instance is signalled by two
	 * things in the client and neither is reachable: a flag on the world view, and a
	 * {@code [4][13][13]} array of TEMPLATE CHUNKS recording which real chunk each chunk of the scene
	 * was copied from. The flag alone would not help -- {@code WorldPointUtil.fromLocalInstance} needs
	 * the chunk table to translate WITH -- and neither can be inferred from what this client already
	 * reads: the scene base and the player position look exactly the same inside an instance as
	 * outside, which is precisely why the failure is silent.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>EXACT CONSEQUENCE. Inside a raid, a boss instance, the Inferno, a POH or a minigame arena,
	 * every WorldPoint the shim reports is the raw scene coordinate of the instance's TEMPLATE
	 * location, not where the player actually is. Shortest Path then pathfinds from a tile far from
	 * the player and drops the target marker there too. Outside instances -- the whole overworld --
	 * every coordinate is correct, which is why nothing has caught it.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>EXACT NEXT STEP. Two offsets, and the anchor for the deob is already in the tree: the native
	 * behind {@code kewl.Natives.sceneBase()} reads this world view's base X/Y, and both the instance
	 * flag and the template-chunk array are fields of that SAME structure. Add them to
	 * {@code client/offsets.hpp}, expose the chunk array through a native next to {@code sceneBase},
	 * and this method plus {@link #getInstanceTemplateChunks()} become plain reads with no other
	 * change anywhere.</p>
