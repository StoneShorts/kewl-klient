/**
 * Doing things.
 *
 * <p>Every method here goes through the game's own menu-action function -- the same one that runs when
 * you right-click something and pick an option. We never build a network packet. The client builds and
 * sends it, which is why this client does not contain a protocol table and does not break every time
 * the protocol changes.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Walking is the exception, and it is the one that works today.</b> The action function is not
 * derived on client-240-6 ({@code DO_ACTION == 0}), so every method here is a no-op returning false --
 * which had auto-walk reporting "cannot act" and never moving. But a human does not walk by calling
 * the action function either: they click the ground. Posted clicks ARE honoured on this build (the
 * autologin plugin's Login and "CLICK HERE TO PLAY" clicks are the proof, seen live 2026-09-06), so
 * {@link #walk} projects the tile and posts a left click on it through {@link Input}. The action path
 * is still PREFERRED and still tried first -- it is exact, it needs no camera, and it will start
 * working the day the offset lands -- but the click is what actually moves the character now.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Two things worth knowing before you use this</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>Actions take world coordinates.</b> The game wants scene coordinates and the conversion happens
 * here, once. If a tile is not in the loaded chunk these methods do nothing and return false, which is
 * the honest answer -- you cannot click a tile the client has not loaded.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>A false can also mean "no action was issued at all".</b> The client's action function could not
 * be derived for this build ({@code DO_ACTION == 0} in {@code client/offsets.hpp}), so every method
 * here except {@link #walk}/{@link #walkTo} is a silent no-op; the boolean return is how you tell.
 * Check it if your plugin must know whether anything actually happened.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Do not spam them.</b> These run on the overlay's thread, not the game's. That is fine at the
 * pace a human clicks and it is asking for trouble in a tight loop. Every plugin in this repo rate
 * limits itself; yours should too.</p>

     * INSIDE the tile at the best ground height we have ({@link Game#heightNear} -- entity heights,

     * tile in FINE units, which is a fraction of a tile at every camera angle -- see
     * {@link #MAX_TILE_JITTER} for why that matters and a pixel jitter would not do.</p>
     *
     * <p>The click is refused rather than sent when it would be nonsense: not logged in (state != 30,
     * so no click ever reaches the title screen), the projection failed (behind the camera), or the
     * point is off the canvas. Off-canvas also covers the control panel, which docks to the RIGHT of
     * the game window rather than over it (see the {@code SetWindowPos} in {@code client/dllmain.cpp})
     * -- a canvas coordinate cannot reach it, and clamping into the canvas would silently walk
     * somewhere the caller did not ask for, so we refuse instead.</p>
     *
     * <p>Not refused, and worth knowing: in FIXED display mode the inventory and minimap are part of
     * the same canvas, so a tile that projects under them clicks the interface instead of the ground.
     * The game's own hit test owns that, we cannot see it from here, and the cost is a wasted click
     * rather than a wrong walk.</p>
     *
     * <p><b>Nothing here is remembered between calls, and that is load-bearing.</b> A caller passes a
     * WORLD tile; the scene conversion, the ground height and the projection all happen inside this
     * call, against the frame it is called on. No screen point survives a call -- the one exception is
     * {@link #press}, which necessarily parks the point it put the button down on so {@link #release}
     * can let it up in the same place, and which is a deliberate pair rather than a cache. So a tile
     * chosen seconds ago (a menu row picked after the menu opened, an auto-walk step chosen
     * before the camera turned) is still clicked where it is NOW, not where it was. If the camera has
     * since swung it behind us, the projection fails and this returns {@link WalkResult#OFF_SCREEN}
     * instead of clicking the stale point -- which is the whole reason the caller gets a result enum
     * rather than a boolean. Review 2026-09-06: the user reported click-to-walk landing in the wrong
     * place; a stale screen point would do exactly that, and this documents that there is not one.</p>
