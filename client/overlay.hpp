// overlay.hpp -- layered-window back buffers, and the one function that puts pixels in them.
//
// The interesting decision here is that C++ does NOT draw anything. Java hands us a finished image once
// a frame and we put it on the screen. That is the opposite of how most clients do it, and it is the
// reason a plugin can draw its overlay with ordinary Java2D -- shapes, alpha, antialiased text, fonts --
// instead of a handful of primitives someone had to expose one at a time.
//
// The cost is one memcpy of a full-screen image per frame. At 1920x1080 that is 8 MB, which sounds
// alarming and takes well under a millisecond. We were already blitting the same number of pixels when
// the drawing was done in C++.
//
// WHY A SEPARATE WINDOW instead of hooking the game's renderer: hooking needs a detour library, a
// graphics API to get right, and it crashes inside someone else's render loop when you get it wrong. A
// layered window is a page of code you can read in one sitting. The cost is that it will not appear in
// screenshots or recordings, and it can flicker. That trade is deliberate.
//
// There are TWO of these windows now: the game overlay (this file's g_overlay, fully click-through) and
// the control panel (panel.hpp, which must receive clicks). The buffer + present logic is shared, which
// is why it is a struct rather than a pile of globals: a Layered is one window's drawing surface, and
// each window owns one.
